# A Python Program / Project

**This is a simple python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the first semester class Introduction to Computer Science 
and is one of a few such simple python programms neccessary to pass the class_


> #### Description of project
>
>>This is a program which keeps in memory a table of 10 columns and 20 rows and that plays "Tetris" only by adding L randomly in the table.
